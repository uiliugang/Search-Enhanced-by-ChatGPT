# Search-Enhanced-by-ChatGPT

- support search engine: bing, google, neeva. 
- If your searching content ends with '?' or '/', this script will send it as prompt to ChatGPT and show the answer in the result page automatically.
- you can config your script settings: max_tokens chatpgpt returns,position of answer container(0: innner, 1: right-side), temperature(float: 0-1, it means relevance) and model you called.

I have tested this script installed in tampermonkey for neeva, google and bing, it works well. you can download from [greasyfork ](https://greasyfork.org/zh-CN/scripts/460673-search-enhanced-by-chatgpt)
